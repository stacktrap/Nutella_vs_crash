# 📊 Absurd Correlations – Episode 1  
## Nutella, Ice Cream & Road Accidents: coincidence or nonsense?

Welcome to the first episode of *Absurd Correlations*, a semi-serious (but 100% data-driven) series where we explore strange patterns in real-world data — and what they can teach us.

In this episode, we ask a critical question:

> 🤔 Does eating more **Nutella** increase the number of **road accidents**?

And what happens if we throw in some **ice cream** too?
